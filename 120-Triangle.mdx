## Hey folks

This is **Day 10** of my LeetCode streak.  

Today’s problem is **120. Triangle** — we’re asked to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom in a triangle of numbers. From each element, you can move to either the same index or the next index in the row below.

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a triangle array.

Return the **minimum path sum** from top to bottom.

At each step, you may move to adjacent numbers in the row below.

### Examples

- Input: `[[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]` → Output: `11`
    
- Input: `[[-10]]` → Output: `-10`
    

### Constraints

- `1 <= triangle.length <= 200`
    
- `triangle[0].length == 1`
    
- `triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1`
    
- `-10^4 <= triangle[i][j] <= 10^4`

## 💡 Intuition

If you think top-down, each path depends on choices below it. Instead of branching recursively, it’s smarter to go **bottom-up**:

- At the bottom row, the minimum path sum is just the value itself.
    
- Moving upward, each element adds its value to the **minimum of its two children** below.
    
- By the time we reach the top, we’ve accumulated the minimum path sum.

## 🔑 Approach

1. Initialize a DP array with the last row of the triangle.
    
2. Iterate from the second-last row up to the first row.
    
3. For each element in the row:
    
    - Update it as `triangle[row][i] + min(dp[i], dp[i+1])`.
        
4. Continue until the top is processed.
    
5. The answer is in `dp[0]`.
    

This reuses one array, achieving **O(n)** space where `n` is the number of rows.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:** `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of elements in the triangle.
    
- **Space complexity:** `O(r)` where `r` is the number of rows (for the DP array).

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} triangle
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumTotal = function(triangle) {
    if (!triangle || triangle.length === 0) return 0;
    if (triangle.length === 1) return triangle[0][0];

    const n = triangle.length;
    const dp = triangle[n - 1].slice(); 

    for (let row = n - 2; row >= 0; row--) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= row; i++) {
            dp[i] = triangle[row][i] + Math.min(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);
        }
    }
    return dp[0];
};

// ✅ Quick tests
console.log(minimumTotal([[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]])); // 11
console.log(minimumTotal([[-10]])); // -10
```

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- Single row triangle like `[[-10]]`.
    
- All negative numbers.
    
- Large triangles up to 200 rows.

## 🎥 Reflections

This problem really showcases how **bottom-up DP** can simplify things — no recursion, no memoization, just smart reuse of space.

That’s it for **Day 10** of my LeetCode journey!  
See you tomorrow for **Day 11** 🚀
