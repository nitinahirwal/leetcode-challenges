title: LeetCode Challenge Day 44 — 3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits  
summary: Day 44 of my LeetCode challenge! Today’s problem is "Smallest Number With All Set Bits". I realized it boils down to finding the next number of the form 2^k - 1 that is greater than or equal to n. I share my JavaScript solution with complexity analysis.

## Hey folks

This is **Day 44** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits** — a **bit manipulation problem** that requires us to find the smallest integer ≥ `n` such that all its binary digits are 1s.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a positive number `n`.  

Return the smallest number `x` such that:  
- `x >= n`  
- The binary representation of `x` contains only set bits (all ones).  

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 in binary is 111.
```
### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: 15 in binary is 1111.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 in binary is 11.
```

## 💡 Intuition

Numbers with all bits set follow a simple pattern:  
1 (1), 3 (11), 7 (111), 15 (1111), 31 (11111), ... → all are of the form **2^k - 1**.  

So the problem reduces to:  
- Find the number of bits needed to represent `n`.  
- Return `2^bits - 1`.  

This will always give the smallest "all set bits" number ≥ `n`.

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Calculate how many bits are required to represent `n`.  
   - Use `Math.clz32(n)` which gives leading zeros in a 32-bit integer.  
   - `bits = 32 - Math.clz32(n)`.  
2. The smallest all-ones number with those many bits is `(1 << bits) - 1`.  
3. Return that value.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\) → only constant-time bit operations.  

- **Space complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\) → no extra data structures.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)  

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var smallestNumber = function(n) {
  // number of bits needed to represent n
  const bits = 32 - Math.clz32(n); 
  // smallest number with all bits set and >= n
  return (1 << bits) - 1;
};
```


## 🧪 Example Walkthrough
Input: n = 10

Binary: 1010 → needs 4 bits.

Smallest all-ones with 4 bits = 1111 = 15.
Output: 15 ✅

## 🎥 Reflections
This was a neat bit manipulation trick.
The problem looks complicated at first, but once you realize it’s about finding the next number of the form 2^k - 1, it becomes very straightforward.

That’s it for Day 44 of my LeetCode journey!
Onwards to Day 45 🔥
