## Hey folks 👋

This is **Day 65** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **2154 — Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two**.

A fun simulation-style problem:  
You repeatedly check whether your current number exists in the array —  
if yes, **double it** and continue the process.

---

## 💡 Intuition

The straightforward idea is:

- If the number is present → multiply by 2  
- Otherwise → stop  

However, repeatedly searching through the array is slow.  
So to optimize, we use a **Set**, allowing constant-time lookups.

---

## 📌 Approach

1. Convert the input `nums` into a **Set** for O(1) search.  
2. While the current `original` value exists inside the Set:
   - Update `original = original * 2`.  
3. When the number is no longer present, return the final value.

This ensures minimal overhead and avoids unnecessary repeated scans.

---

## 📈 Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  Creating the Set takes O(n); the doubling process is very short.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  A Set is used to store the list values.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
var findFinalValue = function(nums, original) {
    const set = new Set(nums);

    while (set.has(original)) {
        original *= 2;
    }

    return original;
};
```

## 🎯 Example

Input:  
`nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3`  
Output:  
`24`

Explanation:  
3 is in `nums` → becomes 6  
6 is in `nums` → becomes 12  
12 is in `nums` → becomes 24  
24 is **not** in `nums`, so we stop.

## 🧠 Reflection

A clean demonstration of how **hashing** simplifies repeated search tasks.  
By converting to a Set, the problem becomes a simple loop instead of repeated array scans.
