## Hey folks

This is **Day 40** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **1716. Calculate Money in LeetCode Bank** — a neat **math/simulation** task where deposits increase daily within each week and the whole week’s base amount also increases each new week.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You deposit money for `n` days:
- Week 1: deposit $1 on Monday, $2 on Tuesday, …, $7 on Sunday.
- Week 2: start from $2 on Monday, then $3, …, $8 on Sunday.
- And so on.

Return the total money after `n` days.

---

## 💡 Intuition

Split `n` into **full weeks** and **leftover days**.  
- Each full week is an arithmetic sequence: the first week sums to `28`, and each subsequent week adds `7` more (because each day’s deposit is `+1` higher).  
- Leftover days continue from the next week’s starting amount `(weeks + 1)`.

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Compute:
   - `weeks = Math.floor(n / 7)`  
   - `days = n % 7`
2. Sum full weeks: week `i` contributes `28 + 7*i` (0-indexed).
3. Sum leftover days: start from `(weeks + 1)` and add one per day.
4. Return `weekTotal + dayTotal`.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:**  
  We iterate through the number of full weeks (≈ `n/7`) and up to `6` leftover days → **O(n)** in the given implementation (can be O(1) with closed-form sums).

- **Space complexity:**  
  Constant extra space → **O(1)**.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalMoney = function(n) {
    let weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);
    let days = n % 7;
    
    // total from full weeks
    let weekTotal = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < weeks; i++) {
        weekTotal += (28 + 7 * i);  // sum of each week
    }
    
    // total from leftover days
    let dayTotal = 0;
    for (let d = 0; d < days; d++) {
        dayTotal += (weeks + 1 + d);
    }
    
    return weekTotal + dayTotal;
};
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

If n = 10:

Full weeks: 1 week → 28

Leftover days: 3 days starting from 2 → 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

Total = 28 + 9 = 37 ✅

## 🎥 Reflections

A small problem with a clean structure. Recognizing the weekly pattern and breaking it into full weeks + leftover days makes the implementation straightforward.
You can also derive closed-form formulas for both parts to make it O(1).
