## Hey folks 👋

This is **Day 75** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today's problem is **Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K** — one of the cleanest math-based problems in the series.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`.  
Your task: **find the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the array divisible by k.**

Each operation allows you to increment any element by `1`.

---

## 💡 Intuition

To make the total sum divisible by `k`, we only need to check:

```
remainder = sum(nums) % k
```

If `remainder == 0`, the sum is already divisible → **0 operations**.  
Otherwise, we need exactly `remainder` increments to reach the next multiple of `k`.

This works because every increment increases the total sum by `1`.

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Compute the total sum of the array.
    
2. Return `sum % k` — the remainder directly represents the number of operations needed.
    

This solution is optimal because increments are the only allowed operation.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var minOperations = function(nums, k) {
    const sum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    return sum % k;
};
```

## 🎯 Reflection

This is a perfect example of how **simple modulo arithmetic** can turn a problem into a one-line solution.

- ✔ No complex logic
    
- ✔ Pure math
    
- ✔ Runs in linear time with constant space
    

That's it for **Day 75** of my LeetCode challenge 💪  
See you tomorrow!
