## Hey folks 👋  
This is **Day 111** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today's problem is **1390. Four Divisors** — a neat number theory problem where recognizing divisor patterns helps avoid brute force.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given:
- An integer array `nums`

**Goal:**  
For every number in the array that has **exactly four divisors**, return the **sum of its divisors**.  
If no such number exists, return `0`.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

Divisors always come in **pairs**.

For a number `n`, if `i` is a divisor, then `n / i` is also a divisor.  
This means we only need to iterate up to **√n**.

The key idea:
> As soon as a number has **more than four divisors**, it becomes irrelevant and we can stop checking it further.

This early stopping keeps the solution efficient even for larger numbers.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Initialize `totalSum` to store the final answer.
2. For each number `n` in `nums`:
   - Start with two guaranteed divisors: `1` and `n`.
   - Iterate from `2` to `√n`.
   - If `i` divides `n`, add both `i` and `n / i` to the divisor list.
   - If the divisor count exceeds `4`, break early.
3. If the number ends up with **exactly four divisors**, add their sum to `totalSum`.
4. Return `totalSum`.

This approach balances **clarity and performance** without over-engineering.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n × √m)`  
  where `n` is the length of the array and `m` is the maximum value in `nums`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(1)`  
  Only a small list of at most four divisors is maintained.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var sumFourDivisors = function(nums) {
    let totalSum = 0;

    for (let n of nums) {
        let divisors = [1, n];

        for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i === 0) {
                divisors.push(i);

                if (i !== n / i) {
                    divisors.push(n / i);
                }

                if (divisors.length > 4) break;
            }
        }

        if (divisors.length === 4) {
            totalSum += divisors.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
        }
    }

    return totalSum;
};
```

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem reinforces an important lesson:

- Not every problem needs complex math — **early pruning** goes a long way
    
- Understanding divisor behavior can drastically reduce work
    
- Clean loops + logical breaks = efficient solutions
