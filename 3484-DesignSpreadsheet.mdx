## Hey folks 

This is **Day 4** of my LeetCode streak. Todayâ€™s problem is **3484. Design Spreadsheet** â€” a parsing + state-management problem where you must support setting and resetting cells and evaluating simple `=X+Y` formulas where `X` and `Y` may be either integers or cell references like `A1`. 

Below I restate the problem, describe a clean, robust approach, give a step-by-step solution and the full JavaScript implementation I used, analyze time & space complexity, list edge-cases and testing ideas, and finally embed a responsive (mobile-friendly) video walkthrough.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

We are asked to implement a **Spreadsheet class** with the following features:

1. **Initialization**  
    A spreadsheet has 26 columns (Aâ€“Z) and `rows` number of rows. Initially, all cells hold the value `0`.
    
2. **Set a cell**  
    `setCell(cell, value)` â†’ Sets the value of the given cell.  
    Example: `A1 = 10`.
    
3. **Reset a cell**  
    `resetCell(cell)` â†’ Resets a cell back to `0`.
    
4. **Evaluate a formula**  
    `getValue(formula)` â†’ Evaluates a formula of the form `=X+Y`, where X and Y can be either:
    
    - A cell reference (like `A1`, `B2`)
        
    - A non-negative integer
        
    
    If a cell hasnâ€™t been set yet, it is treated as `0`.

## ðŸ§© Example

`Input: ["Spreadsheet", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "resetCell", "getValue"] [[3], ["=5+7"], ["A1", 10], ["=A1+6"], ["B2", 15], ["=A1+B2"], ["A1"], ["=A1+B2"]]  Output: [null, 12, null, 16, null, 25, null, 15]`

ðŸ‘‰ Explanation:

- `=5+7` â†’ 12
    
- `A1=10` then `=A1+6` â†’ 16
    
- `B2=15` then `=A1+B2` â†’ 25
    
- Reset `A1=0` â†’ `=A1+B2` â†’ 15

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Approach

When solving this problem, the key idea is to **simulate cell operations** in a simple way:

1. **Storage**  
    Use a map/dictionary to store cell values.  
    Example: `{ "A1": 10, "B2": 15 }`
    
2. **Setting a cell**  
    Just update the map with the new value.
    
3. **Resetting a cell**  
    Remove it from the map so that itâ€™s treated as `0`.
    
4. **Evaluating a formula**
    
    - Strip `=` sign and split by `+`.
        
    - Each part can be either:
        
        - A number â†’ convert to integer.
            
        - A cell reference â†’ fetch from the map (or `0` if not set).
            
    - Return the sum.
        

This approach ensures **O(1)** operations for set/reset/get.

## âš¡ Key Takeaways

- Real-world problems often boil down to **simple data structures** (like maps).
    
- Understanding **input parsing** (e.g., `"=A1+5"`) is crucial in simulation problems.
    
- Donâ€™t overcomplicate â€” keep it simple and efficient.

## Closing notes

- This problem is a great mix of data-structure design and practical engineering trade-offs: "fast access" vs "fast arbitrary updates" â€” the `Map` + `Heap` pattern with lazy deletion is a pragmatic middle ground in JS.
