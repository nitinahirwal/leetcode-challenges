## Hey folks

This is **Day 22** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **1488. Avoid Flood in The City** — a greedy + data-structures problem.

---

## Intuition
We need to prevent floods in lakes when it rains multiple times on the same lake.  
A lake floods only if it rains on it while it's already full.  
To avoid this, we can use the **dry days (`0`s)** to empty lakes before they are rained on again.  

The challenge is deciding **which lake to dry** on each available dry day.  

Key intuition:  
- When a lake gets rain for the second time, we must have already dried it on some day **between the last rain and today**.  
- So, we should always use the **earliest available dry day after the last rain** to dry that lake.  

This is a greedy approach: always dry just in time before a flood happens.

---

## Approach
1. Use an array `ans` for the output:
   - Fill `-1` for rainy days.
   - Fill the lake number for chosen drying days.
   - Default all `0`s with `1` (arbitrary dry choice if unused).
2. Maintain a `Map (lake -> last rain day)` to remember when each lake was last filled.
3. Maintain a sorted list `dryDays` (indices of `0`s).
4. For each day:
   - If `rains[i] > 0`:  
     - If the lake is already full (exists in `lakeMap`):
       - Use binary search on `dryDays` to find the **earliest dry day after last rain day**.  
       - Assign that dry day to dry this lake.  
       - If no valid dry day exists → return `[]` (impossible).
     - Update `lakeMap` with the current day for this lake.
   - If `rains[i] == 0`:  
     - Just store the index in `dryDays` for later assignment.
5. Return the `ans` array.

---

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  - Each rain day lookup/update in map: `O(1)`  
  - Each dry day assignment uses binary search: `O(log n)`  
  - Removing from `dryDays` (array splice) costs `O(n)` worst case.  
  - So worst case: **O(n²)** in JavaScript due to array splice.  
  - With a balanced tree / ordered set (like TreeSet in Java), this can be improved to **O(n log n)**.
  
- **Space complexity:**  
  - `O(n)` for storing `ans`, `lakeMap`, and `dryDays`.

## Code (JavaScript)
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} rains
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var avoidFlood = function(rains) {
    const n = rains.length;
    const ans = new Array(n).fill(1);  // default fill with 1 (for drying days)
    const lakeMap = new Map();         // lake -> last day it rained
    const dryDays = [];                // indices of dry days (0's)

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (rains[i] === 0) {
            // no rain -> we can dry some lake later
            dryDays.push(i);
        } else {
            let lake = rains[i];
            ans[i] = -1;  // raining days are always -1

            if (lakeMap.has(lake)) {
                // This lake is already full -> need to dry it before today
                const lastDay = lakeMap.get(lake);

                // find the first dry day > lastDay
                let idx = binarySearch(dryDays, lastDay);
                if (idx === -1) return []; // no dry day available -> impossible

                let dryIndex = dryDays[idx];
                ans[dryIndex] = lake;  // dry this lake on that day
                dryDays.splice(idx, 1); // remove that dry day from available
            }
            lakeMap.set(lake, i);  // update last rain day
        }
    }
    return ans;
};

// binary search helper: find smallest dryDay > lastDay
function binarySearch(dryDays, lastDay) {
    let left = 0, right = dryDays.length - 1, res = -1;
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (dryDays[mid] > lastDay) {
            res = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

## 🎥 Reflections

This one is a beautiful **just-in-time greedy** puzzle. The “aha” is to treat every repeat rain as a deadline and match it with the **earliest dry day that comes after its last rain**. Once you model dry days as a searchable set and lakes → last-rained indices in a map, the problem turns into **interval scheduling with constraints**.

It’s a great reminder that many scheduling-ish problems boil down to:

- track state with a hash map,
    
- keep future choices in an **ordered set**,
    
- and make the **earliest feasible** choice greedily.
    

That’s it for **Day 22** of my LeetCode journey!  
On to the next challenge 🔥
