## Hey folks

This is **Day 35** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations** — a **simple simulation problem** where we execute increment/decrement operations and track the final result of a variable.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `operations`, where each string is one of:  

- `"--X"`, `"X--"` → decrement by 1  
- `"++X"`, `"X++"` → increment by 1  

Return the final value of variable `X` after performing all operations.  

---

## 💡 Intuition

The operations are straightforward — each one either increases or decreases `X` by 1.  
We can simply simulate the process:  
- Start with `X = 0`.  
- For each operation, check if it contains `"++"` → increment, else decrement.  

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Initialize `X = 0`.  
2. Loop through all operations.  
   - If the operation string contains `"++"`, do `X++`.  
   - Otherwise, do `X--`.  
3. Return the final value of `X`.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:**  
  Each operation is processed in O(1). For `n` operations → **O(n)**.  

- **Space complexity:**  
  Only a constant amount of memory is used → **O(1)**.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function(operations) {
    let X = 0;
    for (let op of operations) {
        if (op.includes("++")) {
            X++;
        } else {
            X--;
        }
    }
    return X;
};
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Input:
operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]

Start: X = 0

"--X" → decrement → X = -1

"X++" → increment → X = 0

"X++" → increment → X = 1

Output: 1

## 🎥 Reflections

This problem is a nice reminder that not every LeetCode challenge needs advanced data structures or algorithms — sometimes a clean, simple simulation does the trick.

That’s it for Day 35 of my LeetCode journey!
Onwards to the next challenge 🔥

Happy Coding 👨‍💻
