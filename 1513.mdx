## Hey folks 👋

This is **Day 62** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **1513 — Number of Substrings With Only 1s**.

It looks simple at first glance, but the trick is to notice how consecutive `1`s form substrings.

---

## 💡 Intuition

When you see consecutive `1`s:

- A run of length `1` → contributes `1`
- A run of length `2` → contributes `1 + 2 = 3`
- A run of length `3` → contributes `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

In general:
```
For a run of length L:  
Total substrings = L × (L + 1) / 2
```

This gives a direct counting approach without generating substrings.

---

## 📌 Approach

1. Iterate through the string left to right.
2. Maintain a variable `run` that counts consecutive `1`s.
3. On every `'1'`:
   - Increment `run`
   - Add `run` to the answer
4. On `'0'`, reset `run = 0`
5. Keep everything modulo **1e9+7**.

This converts a potentially O(n²) substring problem into an efficient **O(n)** solution.

---

## 📈 Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — single pass  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — constant auxiliary space

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript []
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var numSub = function(s) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    let ans = 0;
    let run = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            run += 1;
            ans = (ans + run) % MOD;
        } else {
            run = 0;
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```

## 🎯 Example

Input:

`s = "0110111"`

Output:

`9`

Because runs of `1`s contribute:

- `1` → 1
    
- `11` → 3
    
- `111` → 6
    

Total = **9**

## 🧠 Reflection

This problem reinforces the idea that many substring problems can be simplified by:

- Recognizing **run patterns**
    
- Using **arithmetic formulas**
    
- Avoiding brute-force enumeration
