## Hey folks

This is **Day 12** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **812. Largest Triangle Area** — we’re given a list of points on a 2D plane, and we need to figure out the largest possible area of any triangle that can be formed using 3 of those points.  

At first, it sounds like a geometry puzzle, but with the right formula and some brute force, it becomes very straightforward.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` where each element is `[xi, yi]` representing a coordinate on the XY-plane.  
Return the maximum area of a triangle that can be formed from any 3 different points.  

### Examples

- Input: `[[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]`  
  Output: `2.00000`  
  Explanation: The triangle formed by `[0,2], [2,0], [0,0]` has the largest area = 2.  

- Input: `[[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]`  
  Output: `0.50000`  
  Explanation: These three points form a right triangle with area = 0.5.  

### Constraints

- `3 <= points.length <= 50`  
- `-50 <= xi, yi <= 50`  
- All the given points are unique.

## 💡 Intuition

To find the area of a triangle given 3 vertices, the **shoelace formula** (also called the surveyor’s formula) is the perfect tool.  

For 3 points `(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)`, the area is:

\[ Area = \frac{|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|}{2} \]

Since the constraints are small (`n <= 50`), we can afford to simply try **all possible triplets** of points and compute their area, keeping track of the maximum.  

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Define a helper function `triArea(p1, p2, p3)` that uses the shoelace formula to compute the area of the triangle from 3 points.  
2. Loop through all combinations of 3 points `(i, j, k)` from the array.  
3. For each triplet, calculate the area and update the maximum if it’s larger.  
4. Return the maximum area at the end.  

The brute-force approach works perfectly here because:  
- With at most 50 points, the number of triplets is \(\binom{50}{3} = 19600\), which is very manageable.  

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:** O(n³) — we check all triplets. With `n = 50`, this is totally fine.  
- **Space complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables are used.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestTriangleArea = function(points) {
    const n = points.length;
    let maxArea = 0;

    // Helper: compute triangle area using shoelace formula
    const triArea = (a, b, c) => {
        const [x1, y1] = a;
        const [x2, y2] = b;
        const [x3, y3] = c;
        return Math.abs(
            x1 * (y2 - y3) +
            x2 * (y3 - y1) +
            x3 * (y1 - y2)
        ) / 2;
    };

    // Try all triplets
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (let k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, triArea(points[i], points[j], points[k]));
            }
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
};

// ✅ Quick tests
console.log(largestTriangleArea([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]])); // 2
console.log(largestTriangleArea([[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]])); // 0.5
```


## 🧪 Edge Cases

- **All points in a line** → largest area = `0`.
    
- **Small right triangles** (like `[0,0], [1,0], [0,1]`) → should return proper fractional value.
    
- **Negative coordinates** → formula still works, since it uses absolute values.

## 🎥 Reflections

This problem is a neat reminder that sometimes **brute force + the right math formula** is all you need.  
No fancy algorithms, just good old geometry applied efficiently.

It also reinforced the importance of knowing handy formulas (like shoelace), because they instantly simplify geometry problems.

That’s it for **Day 12** of my LeetCode journey!  
Excited for what Day 13 brings 🔥
