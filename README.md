# 🚀 LeetCode Challenges by Nitin Ahirwal

Welcome to my **LeetCode Challenge Repository**!  
I am solving problems daily and documenting them with **detailed explanations, approaches, code, complexity analysis, edge cases, and reflections**.  

This repo is not just about code — it’s about **learning patterns, building intuition, and showcasing problem-solving skills**.  

---

## 📂 Structure
Each challenge is stored in a dedicated folder:



---

## 🏆 Goals
- Maintain a **daily problem-solving streak** 🗓️
- Build a **portfolio of DSA skills**
- Share learnings openly to help others preparing for interviews
- Create a resource I can revisit when tackling similar problems
