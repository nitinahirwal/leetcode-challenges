## Hey folks 👋

This is **Day 68** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **3190 — Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three**.

Given an array `nums`, in one operation we can **add or subtract 1 from an element**.  
Our task is to make **all elements divisible by 3** with the **minimum number of operations**.

---

## 💡 Intuition

Every number is at most **one step away** from a multiple of 3:

| `num % 3` | Action | Cost |
|----------|--------|------|
| `0`      | Already divisible by 3 | 0 |
| `1`      | Do `num - 1` | 1 |
| `2`      | Do `num + 1` | 1 |

So every element that is **not divisible by 3** requires **exactly one operation**.

---

## 📌 Approach

1. Loop through the array.
2. If a number is divisible by 3 → no change needed.
3. Otherwise → increment the operation counter.
4. Return the counter.

Because each non-divisible number costs exactly **one operation**,  
the result is just the number of elements where `num % 3 !== 0`.

## 📈 Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumOperations = function(nums) {
    let ops = 0;
    
    for (const x of nums) {
        if (x % 3 !== 0) {
            ops += 1;
        }
    }
    
    return ops;
};
```

## 🧠 Reflection

Not every problem needs simulation — sometimes **a mathematical observation** gives the most optimal solution.  
Realizing that every number is only **one step away from being divisible by 3** simplifies the challenge drastically.

See you tomorrow for **Day 69**! 🚀  
Happy Coding 👨‍💻✨
