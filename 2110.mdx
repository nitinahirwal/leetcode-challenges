## Hey folks 👋  
This is **Day 91** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today's problem is **2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock** — a clean problem where consistency in thinking beats brute force.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given an integer array `prices`, where `prices[i]` represents the stock price on the `i`-th day.

A **smooth descent period**:
- Consists of one or more **contiguous days**
- Each day's price is **exactly 1 less** than the previous day
- A single day always counts as a valid period

**Goal:**  
Return the total number of smooth descent periods.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

Every individual day forms a valid smooth descent period.

The important observation is:
> A smooth descent only continues when the price drops by **exactly 1**.

So instead of checking all possible subarrays, we track:
- The length of the **current descending streak**
- How many valid periods **end at each day**

If a streak has length `k`, it contributes `k` smooth descent periods ending at that position.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Initialize:
   - `curr = 1` → current descent streak length
   - `ans = 1` → the first day itself
2. Traverse the array from index `1`:
   - If `prices[i - 1] - prices[i] === 1`, increment `curr`
   - Otherwise, reset `curr` to `1`
3. Add `curr` to `ans` at each step
4. Return `ans` after completing the traversal

This ensures all valid periods are counted efficiently in one pass.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)` — single pass through the array

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(1)` — constant extra space

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var getDescentPeriods = function(prices) {
    let ans = 1;       // first day itself
    let curr = 1;      // current descent length

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i - 1] - prices[i] === 1) {
            curr += 1;     // extend descent
        } else {
            curr = 1;      // reset
        }
        ans += curr;
    }

    return ans;
};
```

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem reinforces a core lesson:

- Track what **ends at the current index**
    
- Let patterns accumulate naturally
    
- One-pass solutions are often hiding in plain sight
    

That wraps up **Day 91** of my LeetCode challenge 🔥  
Staying consistent, one problem at a time 🚀
