## Hey folks 👋  

Today’s problem is **3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference** —  
an elegant math-based problem where a single insight lets you solve it in **O(n)** without checking each partition individually.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.  
A partition at index `i` splits the array into:

- Left: `nums[0…i]`  
- Right: `nums[i+1…n-1]`  

A partition is **valid** if:

\[
\left(\text{sum(left)} - \text{sum(right)}\right)
\]

is **even**.

Return the **number of valid partitions**.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

Let:

- `L = sum(left)`
- `R = sum(right)`
- `S = total sum = L + R`

The difference is:

\[
\text{diff} = L - R = L - (S - L) = 2L - S
\]

Here’s the key observation:

### ✅ `2L` is always even  
So the parity of `diff` depends **only on `S`**.

Therefore:

- If **total sum `S` is even → diff is always even → all `(n - 1)` partitions are valid**
- If **total sum `S` is odd → diff is always odd → no partition works**

This turns the problem into a simple sum and parity check!

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Compute the total sum `S` of the array.
2. If `S` is **even**, return `n - 1` — because every split works.
3. If `S` is **odd**, return `0` — because no split can produce an even difference.
4. Done.

No prefix sums, no checking each split, nothing complicated.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) — Only the array sum is computed.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript []
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPartitions = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let total = 0;
    for (let x of nums) total += x;
    return (total % 2 === 0) ? (n - 1) : 0;
};
```

## 🧩 Example Walkthrough

### Example

Input:  
`[10, 10, 3, 7, 6]`  
Total sum = 36 → even  
Partitions = `n - 1 = 4`

Output:  
`4`

### Example

Input:  
`[1, 2, 2]`  
Total sum = 5 → odd  
No valid partitions.

Output:  
`0`

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem is a perfect example of how **mathematical reasoning** can simplify what first appears to be a brute-force task.

Instead of iterating through partition sums, a quick parity insight collapses the entire problem into a **one-line condition**.

That’s it for today’s challenge!  
See you in the next one 🚀
