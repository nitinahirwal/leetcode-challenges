## Hey folks 👋  

This is **Day 81** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference** — a clean and elegant math-based problem.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A partition at index `i` splits the array into:

- Left subarray: `nums[0..i]`  
- Right subarray: `nums[i+1..n-1]`  

A partition is valid if:

sum(left) - sum(right)

is even.

Return the number of valid partitions.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

Let:

- L = sum(left)  
- R = sum(right)  
- S = total sum = L + R  

Then:

diff = L - R = 2L - S

Since `2L` is always even, the parity of the result depends **only on S**.

- If S is even → all partitions result in an even difference → valid = n - 1  
- If S is odd → no partition results in an even difference → valid = 0  

This is the key observation that simplifies the problem completely.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Compute the total sum S.  
2. If S is even, return n - 1.  
3. If S is odd, return 0.  

No prefix sums needed, no checking every index.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- Time Complexity: O(n)  
- Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPartitions = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let total = 0;
    for (let x of nums) total += x;
    return (total % 2 === 0) ? (n - 1) : 0;
};
```

## 🧩 Example Walkthrough

Input:  
[10, 10, 3, 7, 6]  
Total = 36 (even)  
Valid partitions = 4

Output: 4

Input:  
[1, 2, 2]  
Total = 5 (odd)  
Valid partitions = 0

Output: 0

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem shows how math can simplify logic-heavy tasks.  
Instead of evaluating every partition, a simple parity check solves everything in constant time.

That’s it for **Day 81** of my LeetCode challenge 💪
