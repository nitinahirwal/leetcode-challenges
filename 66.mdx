## Hey folks 👋  
This is **Day 108** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today's problem is **66. Plus One** — an easy problem on paper, but a great test of clean thinking and edge-case handling.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given:
- An array `digits` representing a **non-negative integer**
- Each element is a single digit (`0–9`)
- Digits are ordered from **most significant to least significant**
- No leading zeroes

**Goal:**  
Increment the number by **one** and return the resulting digits array.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

This problem is just **elementary addition**, applied to an array.

Key observations:
- Addition starts from the **last digit**
- If a digit is less than `9`, increment it and stop
- If a digit is `9`, it becomes `0` and generates a **carry**
- If all digits are `9`, the carry propagates through the entire array and creates a new leading `1`

So the entire problem boils down to **handling carry correctly**.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Traverse the array from **right to left**
2. For each digit:
   - If it’s less than `9`, increment it and return immediately
   - Otherwise, set it to `0` and continue
3. If the loop completes, all digits were `9`
   - Insert `1` at the beginning of the array
4. Return the updated array

This avoids converting the array into a number and works efficiently for large inputs.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  `O(n)` — single pass through the digits

- **Space Complexity:**  
  `O(1)` — in-place modification (excluding output)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} digits
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var plusOne = function(digits) {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (digits[i] < 9) {
            digits[i]++;
            return digits;
        }
        digits[i] = 0;
    }
    
    // If all digits were 9
    digits.unshift(1);
    return digits;
};
```

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem reinforces an important lesson:

- Simple problems test **discipline**, not difficulty
    
- Carry handling is a recurring pattern in many harder problems
    
- Clean early returns keep the code readable
    

That wraps up **Day 108** of my LeetCode challenge 🔥  
On to Day 109 — consistency beats intensity 🚀

**Happy Coding 👨‍💻**
