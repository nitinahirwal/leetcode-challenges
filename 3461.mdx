## Hey folks

This is **Day 38** of my LeetCode streak 🚀.  
Today’s problem is **3461. Check If Digits Are Equal in String After Operations I** — an **easy simulation problem** where we repeatedly reduce a string of digits until only two remain, then check if those two digits are equal.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits. Perform the following operation until `s` has exactly two digits:  

- For each pair of consecutive digits in `s`, calculate a new digit as `(s[i] + s[i+1]) % 10`.  
- Replace `s` with the sequence of these new digits.  

Return `true` if the final two digits are equal, otherwise return `false`.

---

## 💡 Intuition

The key observation is that we don’t need to optimize anything — the input size is at most 100, so we can **directly simulate** the process.  

At each step, the length of the string decreases by 1, and after at most `n-2` steps we’ll reach exactly two digits.  

---

## 🔑 Approach

1. Convert the input string into an array of digits.  
2. While the array length is greater than 2:  
   - Create a new array.  
   - For each consecutive pair, compute `(arr[i] + arr[i+1]) % 10`.  
   - Replace the old array with this new one.  
3. Once only 2 digits remain, check if they are equal.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:**  
  Each step reduces the array length by 1, and each step costs up to `O(n)`.  
  Total complexity: **O(n²)**, which is fine for `n ≤ 100`.  

- **Space complexity:**  
  We only store arrays proportional to the size of the input.  
  So, **O(n)**.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasSameDigits = function(s) {
    // Convert string to array of digits
    let arr = s.split("").map(Number);

    // Keep reducing until only 2 digits left
    while (arr.length > 2) {
        let next = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            next.push((arr[i] + arr[i + 1]) % 10);
        }
        arr = next;
    }

    // Check if last two digits are equal
    return arr[0] === arr[1];
};
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Input:  
`s = "3902"`

Steps:

- First reduction: `"3902"` → `"292"`
    
- Second reduction: `"292"` → `"11"`
    

Since the last two digits are the same, the result is **true** ✅.

## 🎥 Reflections

This problem is a great reminder that sometimes brute-force simulation is the simplest and most effective strategy when input sizes are small.  
It also reinforces the importance of checking constraints before over-optimizing.

That’s it for Day 38 of my LeetCode journey!  
Onwards to the next challenge 🔥
