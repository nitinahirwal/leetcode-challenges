## Hey folks 👋  

This is **Day 49** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful** — a **medium-level** greedy problem involving strings and optimization of removal costs.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope, represented by the string `colors`,  
where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i`th balloon.  

Each balloon requires `neededTime[i]` seconds to remove.  
Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**, meaning **no two consecutive balloons have the same color**.  

Return the **minimum total time** needed to remove balloons to achieve this.

---

## 💡 Intuition  

When two or more consecutive balloons have the same color, we must remove all but one.  
To minimize total time, we should **keep the balloon that takes the longest to remove** and remove the rest.  

So, for every group of identical consecutive colors,  
we calculate:  
→ **sum of removal times − maximum removal time**  
and add it to our total cost.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. Iterate through the `colors` string.  
2. For each consecutive group of same-colored balloons:
   - Calculate the total sum of removal times (`runSum`).
   - Find the maximum removal time in that group (`runMax`).
   - Add `(runSum - runMax)` to the total cost.  
3. When the color changes, reset the group tracking variables.  
4. After the loop, add the cost from the last group.  

This ensures we only remove the minimum necessary balloons to make the rope colorful.

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) — Single traversal through the balloons.

- **Space complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) — Only a few variables are used for sums and maximums.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} colors
 * @param {number[]} neededTime
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCost = function(colors, neededTime) {
    const n = colors.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;

    let total = 0;
    let runSum = neededTime[0];
    let runMax = neededTime[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (colors[i] === colors[i - 1]) {
            runSum += neededTime[i];
            runMax = Math.max(runMax, neededTime[i]);
        } else {
            total += runSum - runMax; // remove all but the max in the previous run
            runSum = neededTime[i];
            runMax = neededTime[i];
        }
    }

    // finalize the last run
    total += runSum - runMax;
    return total;
};

// Tests (from the prompt)
console.log(minCost("abaac", [1,2,3,4,5])); // 3
console.log(minCost("abc", [1,2,3]));       // 0
console.log(minCost("aabaa", [1,2,3,4,1])); // 2
```

### 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Input:
colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

Steps:

Balloons a(1) and a(3) → remove the one with less time (3 seconds).
✅ Total = 3

Output:
3

### 🎯 Reflection

This problem beautifully showcases how greedy choices can minimize cost efficiently.
By always keeping the balloon with the highest removal time,
we ensure no unnecessary deletions and achieve the optimal result.

That’s it for Day 49 of my LeetCode journey 💪
