## Hey folks

This is **Day 8** of my LeetCode streak.  
Not the most productive day overall — lots of distractions, a bit of Twitter doomscrolling 😅 — but I promised myself I’d keep this streak alive for **199 days straight**, so here’s today’s grind 💪.

Today’s problem is **165. Compare Version Numbers** — a string parsing and comparison puzzle. It’s less about data structures and more about careful step-by-step handling of edge cases like leading zeros and missing revisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

You’re given two version strings, `version1` and `version2`.  
Each version string consists of revisions separated by dots `"."`.  
Each revision is an integer (ignoring leading zeros).

We need to compare them:

- If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
    
- If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
    
- Otherwise, return `0`.
    

Rules:

- If one version string has fewer revisions, treat the missing parts as `"0"`.
    
- Leading zeros should be ignored (`"01"` and `"001"` are just `1`).
    

### Examples

- Input: `"1.2"`, `"1.10"`  
    Output: `-1`  
    Explanation: compare second revisions → 2 < 10.
    
- Input: `"1.01"`, `"1.001"`  
    Output: `0`  
    Explanation: both resolve to the same revisions `[1, 1]`.
    
- Input: `"1.0"`, `"1.0.0.0"`  
    Output: `0`  
    Explanation: missing revisions count as zeros.
    

### Constraints

- `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
    
- Both strings contain only digits and `"."`.
    
- Revisions fit in a 32-bit integer.

## 💡 Intuition

The key is that version numbers are **sequences of integers separated by dots**.  
So instead of comparing raw strings, we should:

1. Split the versions into arrays.
    
2. Compare revision by revision as integers.
    
3. If one runs out of revisions, treat the missing ones as `0`.
    

This way, leading zeros don’t mess us up, and we can handle versions of different lengths smoothly.

## 🔑 Approach

1. Split both `version1` and `version2` by `"."` into arrays.
    
2. Find the maximum length of the two arrays → ensures we compare all revisions.
    
3. For each index `i`:
    
    - Parse the revision to an integer, or use `0` if the revision doesn’t exist.
        
    - Compare `num1` and `num2`.
        
    - If one is smaller, return `-1`; if larger, return `1`.
        
4. If no differences are found after the loop, return `0`.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the maximum number of revisions in the two version strings.
    
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` to hold the split arrays.

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```js
/**
 * @param {string} version1
 * @param {string} version2
 * @return {number}
 */
var compareVersion = function(version1, version2) {
    let v1 = version1.split(".");
    let v2 = version2.split(".");
    
    let n = Math.max(v1.length, v2.length);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let num1 = i < v1.length ? parseInt(v1[i]) : 0;
        let num2 = i < v2.length ? parseInt(v2[i]) : 0;
        
        if (num1 < num2) return -1;
        if (num1 > num2) return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
};

// ✅ Quick tests
console.log(compareVersion("1.2", "1.10"));   // -1
console.log(compareVersion("1.01", "1.001")); // 0
console.log(compareVersion("1.0", "1.0.0.0"));// 0
console.log(compareVersion("2.5", "2.3"));    // 1
```

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- `"1.0"` vs `"1.0.0"` → should be equal.
    
- `"1.01"` vs `"1.001"` → leading zeros ignored.
    
- Versions with completely different lengths (`"1"` vs `"1.0.0.0.0"`) should still be equal.

## 🎥 Reflections

This problem is all about **clean parsing and careful comparison**.  
It reminded me that even simple-looking problems can hide tricky details like leading zeros and uneven array lengths. Handling them systematically is the key.
