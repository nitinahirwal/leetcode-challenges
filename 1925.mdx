## Hey folks 👋  
This is **Day 84** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today's problem is **1925. Count Square Sum Triples** — an **easy** problem that revisits the classic **Pythagorean theorem** with clean constraints and a straightforward approach.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
A **square triple** `(a, b, c)` is defined such that:
`a² + b² = c²`

Given an integer `n`, count how many such ordered triples exist where:
`1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n`

**Example:**  
```Input: n = 5  
Output: 2  
Explanation: (3,4,5) and (4,3,5)

Input: n = 10  
Output: 4  
Explanation: (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), (8,6,10)`
```
---

## 💡 Intuition  
The equation `a² + b² = c²` directly points to **Pythagorean triples**.

Since the constraint is small (`n ≤ 250`), we don’t need any advanced math optimizations.  
The key idea is:
- Try all possible values of `a` and `b`
- Check if `a² + b²` forms a perfect square `c²` within range

To make this check fast, we can **precompute all squares** from `1²` to `n²`.

---

## 🔑 Approach  
1. Precompute a set of squares of all numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. Iterate through all ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n`.
3. Calculate `a² + b²` for each pair.
4. If this value exists in the square set, it means:
`a² + b² = c² (for some 1 ≤ c ≤ n)`
so we count it as a valid square triple.
5. Return the final count.

**Important note:**  
- `(a, b, c)` and `(b, a, c)` are treated as **different triples**, which is why both are counted.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  
| Complexity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Time     | $$O(n^2)$$ |
| Space    | $$O(n)$$ |

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)
```javascript
/**
* @param {number} n
* @return {number}
*/
var countTriples = function(n) {
 // Precompute all squares from 1 to n
 const squares = new Set();
 for (let c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
     squares.add(c * c);
 }

 let count = 0;

 // Check all ordered pairs (a, b)
 for (let a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
     for (let b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
         const sum = a * a + b * b;
         if (squares.has(sum)) {
             count++;
         }
     }
 }

 return count;
};
```

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem is a nice reminder that:

- Constraints guide the solution approach
    
- Precomputation can turn expensive checks into constant-time operations
    
- Classic math concepts often appear in competitive programming
