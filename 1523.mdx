## Hey folks 👋  

This is **Day 83** of my LeetCode streak 🚀  
Today’s problem is **1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range** — a neat problem that rewards spotting a simple pattern instead of brute force.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

You are given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`.

Your task is to return the count of **odd numbers** between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

---

## 💡 Intuition  

At first glance, it might seem natural to loop through the range and count odd numbers.  
However, since `high` can be as large as `10⁹`, iterating would be inefficient.

The key observation is:
- Odd numbers appear at **regular intervals**
- Roughly half of the numbers in any range are odd

So instead of checking every number, we can compute the answer directly using math.

---

## 🔑 Approach  

1. The number of odd numbers from `0` to `x` (inclusive) is:
`floor((x + 1) / 2)`
2. Count odd numbers from `0` to `high`
3. Count odd numbers from `0` to `low - 1`
4. Subtract the two values to get the count of odd numbers in `[low, high]`

This gives us a constant-time solution without any loops.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} low
 * @param {number} high
 * @return {number}
 */
var countOdds = function(low, high) {
    return Math.floor((high + 1) / 2) - Math.floor(low / 2);
};
```

## 🧩 Example Walkthrough

**Input:**  
`low = 3, high = 7`

Odd numbers: `[3, 5, 7]`  
**Output:** `3`

---

**Input:**  
`low = 8, high = 10`

Odd numbers: `[9]`  
**Output:** `1`

---

## 🎯 Reflection

This problem is a great reminder that:

- Not every problem needs loops
    
- Simple math observations can drastically simplify a solution
    
- Thinking in terms of patterns often beats brute force
    

That’s it for **Day 83** of my LeetCode challenge 💪
